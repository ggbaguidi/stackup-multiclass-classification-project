# Python End-to-end Multiclass Classification Project

In today's world, data is the new oil. With the rise of machine learning, businesses can leverage data to make data-driven decisions. One of the important aspects of machine learning is classification. Classification is the process of identifying to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs. There are many types of classification problems, one of which is multiclass classification.

Multiclass classification is a type of classification problem where the aim is to classify the input data into three or more classes. For example, classifying different types of flowers into their respective species. In this context, Python is a powerful language to build end-to-end multiclass classification projects.

In a Python end-to-end multiclass classification project, we start by acquiring data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, applying feature engineering to extract relevant features, selecting a model, training the model, and finally evaluating the model.

The first step of a Python end-to-end multiclass classification project is data acquisition. This can involve web scraping, downloading from public repositories or using datasets that are provided within Python libraries. Next, we need to clean and preprocess the data. This involves removing null values, handling missing data, and encoding categorical variables.

After cleaning the data, the next step is feature engineering. Feature engineering is the process of selecting relevant features that best represent the data. This includes feature scaling, normalization, and selecting important features using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

Once the data is ready, we can start building our model. There are several models that can be used for multiclass classification, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. Once we have selected a model, the next step is to train the model using our cleaned and preprocessed data.

Finally, we need to evaluate the performance of our model. We can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the performance of our model. We can also use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model is not overfitted.

In conclusion, Python end-to-end multiclass classification projects are a powerful way to leverage data and make data-driven decisions. With the right tools and techniques, businesses can build robust models that can handle complex classification problems.
## Project Overview & EDA

In this Python end-to-end multiclass classification project, we will be using the Road Traffic Severity Classification dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about road accidents and their severity. The aim of this project is to predict the severity of an accident based on various features such as location, weather, and road conditions.

### Data Acquisition

To acquire the dataset, we will be using the Kaggle API. First, we need to install the Kaggle package using the following command:```
!pip install kaggle

```

Next, we need to set up our Kaggle credentials using the following code:

```
import os
os.environ['KAGGLE_USERNAME'] = 'your_kaggle_username'
os.environ['KAGGLE_KEY'] = 'your_kaggle_api_key'

```

We can now download the dataset using the following command:

```
!kaggle datasets download -d avikumart/road-traffic-severity-classification

```

Once the dataset is downloaded, we can extract the files using the following command:

```
!unzip road-traffic-severity-classification.zip

```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

To perform EDA, we will be using the pandas library to load and manipulate the data. We can load the data using the following code:

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
df.head()

```

We can then explore the data using various visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. We can also compute descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to get a better understanding of the data.

Overall, this Python end-to-end multiclass classification project will involve acquiring the dataset, performing EDA to gain insights about the data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and finally selecting a model and evaluating its performance.
